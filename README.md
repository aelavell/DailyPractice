# DailyPractice

Exploring Flutter, one day at a time.

This codebase is regularly updated + deployed to [https://daily-practice-app.firebase.com].

## Motivation

I am learning Flutter currently as it seems to offer a promising path to
truly modular + reusable UIs, developed once and deployed cross platform.

My interests are as follows:

- Crafting small, animated interactions that help close the gap between person & computer
- Crafting large, modular codebases which lay foundations on which to rapidly build & deploy apps
- Connecting the dots between app // website // game // audio // visual // computer // human // experience

I have been developing native iOS for a very long time.

Inherent challenges with native development:

- UI iteration speed is slow 
- State Management + modularity are difficult to implement properly
- Only being able to work + deploy in one ecosystem is unncessarily restrictive and not representative of the diversity of computing as a whole

I am not as familiar with Android, but the problems are similar.

These and other reasons have led me to this point. Perhaps Flutter is the answer, perhaps not. I intend to find out, over time.
