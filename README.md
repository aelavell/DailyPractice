# DailyPractice

Exploring Flutter, one day at a time.

This codebase is regularly updated + deployed to [https://daily-practice-app.firebase.com].

I am learning Flutter currently as it seems to offer a promising path to
truly modular + reusable UIs, developed once and deployed cross platform.

My interests are as follows:

- Crafting small, animated interactions that help close the gap between person & computer
- Crafting large, modular codebases which lay foundations on which to rapidly build & deploy apps
- Connecting the dots between app // website // game // audio // visual // computer // human // experience

I have been developing native iOS for a very long time,
anyone who has done that knows the inherent challenges:

- UI Iteration Speed
- State Management + modularity issues ([Massive View Controllers](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/159/how-to-refactor-massive-view-controllers))
- Limitations of only being able to work + deploy in one ecosystem

Good Luck ~
