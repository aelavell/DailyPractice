# DailyPractice

Exploring Flutter, one day at a time.

This codebase is regularly updated + deployed to [https://uxprac.web.app].

NOTE: This is designed for phone screen aspect. If on a laptop, resize
your browser window accordingly. Some layouts may make sense on normal
laptop browser aspect - others definitely won't.

## Releases:

- [https://uxprac.web.app/5] prototype calendar view (first grid attempt in flutter)
- [https://uxprac.web.app/4] swaps out the counter for three mini-circles
- [https://uxprac.web.app/3] adds a counter of how many completed interactions
- [https://uxprac.web.app/2] interaction + complete at the end
- [https://uxprac.web.app/1] "action complete" animation
- [https://uxprac.web.app/0] original interactive circle animation concept

## Interests

- Crafting small, animated interactions that help close the gap between person & computer
- Crafting large, modular codebases which lay foundations on which to rapidly build & deploy apps
- Connecting the dots between app // website // game // audio // visual // computer // human // experience

## Motivation

I am learning Flutter currently as it seems to offer a promising path to
truly modular + reusable UIs, developed once and deployed cross platform.


### Challenges in Native Dev

I have been developing native iOS for a very long time.

Inherent challenges with native development:

- UI iteration speed is slow 
- State Management + modularity are difficult to implement properly
- Only being able to work + deploy in one ecosystem is unncessarily restrictive and not representative of the diversity of computing as a whole

I am not as familiar with Android, but the problems are similar.

## The Path 

These and other reasons have led me to this point. Perhaps Flutter is the answer, perhaps not. I intend to find out, over time.
